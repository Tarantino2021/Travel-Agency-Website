# Travel-Agency-Website

It is a static Travel Agency site with 4 pages using Framer Motion and GSAP for subtle animation and transitions. It is fully responsive. I utilize modern UI/UX designs throught the website.


* The Home page utilizes GSAP animation when the site is loaded initially to reveal the content.

* The Approach page has 4 sections each broken down to their own components. Subtle scroll animation used in this page.

* The Services page has 3 sections and an Accordion section which is a component within a section. I utilize Framer Motion animation in this page.

* The About Us page has 3 sections, and 2 separate components within the third section: Cards and Calendar. This page has a slider I build with Javascript and use Framer Motion for transitions. Cards are separate component; I use CSS Grid. The Calendar is built with the React-Date-Range.

* The Footer, Header and Menu are self-explanatory. I have just used GSAP animation to open and close the menu much smoother. 

* For Responsive design I used Include-Media documents for SASS.
